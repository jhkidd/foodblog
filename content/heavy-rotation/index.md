# Meera Sodha - Butter beans in salsa verde

* 5¼ tbsp (20g) picked flat-leaf parsley
* 3¾ tbsp (20g) picked basil leaves
* 3¾ tbsp (20g) picked mint leaves (ie, from around 10 sprigs)
* 3 tbsp capers, drained
* 1 tbsp red-wine vinegar
* 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced
* 75ml olive oil (5 tbsp), plus 2 tbsp extra for cooking the beans
* 2 x 400g tins butterbeans, not drained
* 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 red chilli (optional)
* ¾ tsp fine sea salt (or to taste)

Honestly, it work well with the parsley, basil and mint, but you can throw in whatever green herbs you've got and it's going to taste good.

Put all the herbs on a large chopping board and finely chop with the capers and one of the garlic cloves, then transfer to a bowl, stir in the vinegar and the olive oil, and put to one side (alternatively, put all of these ingredients in the small bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped and mixed, but not pureed).

Drain away about three tablespoons of the liquid from one of the tins of butter beans, but leave the other one as it is. Put two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and, once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for eight minutes, until really soft and starting to turn golden. Add the second garlic clove and the chilli, cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then tip in the butter beans and all their remaining liquid. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until the beans are soft and the stock has reduced a little, then stir in the salsa verde and salt to taste. Take off the heat and serve at once with toasted ciabatta to mop up the juices.

# Jamie Oliver - Mozzarella and aubergine pasta

* 1 aubergine
* 1 onion
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 tin tomatoes
* splash of balsamic vinegar
* chilli flakes
* basil
* single cream
* mozzarella
* parmesan/peccorino (optional but not really)

Apologies for the imprecise measurements, this one is mostly from memory, I don't have the original recipe.

Cube an aubergine and salt it over the sink to draw out moisture. After about half an hour, dry them off and then gently fry in a lot of olive oil. After they’ve cooked for a bit, add a chopped onion and garlic, continue to cook until onion is soft. Add in a tin of chopped tomatoes and a splash of balsamic vinegar, some chilli flakes, salt and pepper, and the chopped stalks of a handful of basil. Simmer for 20 minutes then pour in some cream. Take it off the heat and mix it into your pasta, then tear some mozzarella in. The heat of the pasta will be enough to gently start to melt the cheese. Top with the basil leaves and a grating of parmesan.
