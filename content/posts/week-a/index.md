# Special one-off: Saturday Jan 31st

This is a special one-off entry in the blog, as it wouldn't do it justice to try and squeeze it into the weekly post. Andrew and I went to Tom Barne's restaurant Skof, in a former drapery warehouse near New Century. This is the first michelin stared restaurant I've ever eaten in, and we went for a staggering 18 course tasting menu, with a mixed drink pairing. 

The atmosphere and the staff were great, really friendly and welcoming. It's pretty relaxed inside, the food was fine dining but it didn't feel silver service.

As soon as we sat down and they took our coats we had a broth of Grilled onion and lemon thyme. Nice and warming after the dash to the restaurant in the rain.

After we'd settled on the longer tasting menu, the first few courses came out pretty quick. They're all meant to be eaten in a single bite.

The first was a celeriac tartlet, covered in roasted yeast, and with cured egg yolk.

Next was a whipped goats cheese curd, with jerusalem artichokes and shiso vinegar, between two cheese biscuits.

The third bite was the best one of the three, salt-baked Kohlrabi on a small potato flatbread. There were fermented gooseberries under the Kohlrabi which gave it a sweetness.

After that we had a small plate of sugarsnax carrots which had been coated in a slated plum condiment. It was more sour than I expected, I guess I thought plum would be sweet.
