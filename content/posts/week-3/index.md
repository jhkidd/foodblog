# Jan 11th: Beyond meat cheeseburger

I've officially broken the seal on restaurant meals now, first one was at Navarro lounge. All in all had a nice Cultural™ Sunday out. We visited the Whitworth art gallery, the had a free performance by some students from the RNCM, a trombone quartet. I hadn't appreciated how much spit playing the trombone generates, there was a small puddle around them by the end.
