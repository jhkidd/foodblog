# Jan 25th: Parsnip gnocci with mustard-marinated kale, and spring onion salad

On the sunday my parent's came round to book out flights to Switzerland later in the year. Andrew and I pulled out all the stops making a meal for us all. I went with the Parsnip gnocci I made a couple of weeks ago, with two of Ottolenghi's salads on the side

Mustard-marinated kale with asparagus

Spring onion and herb salad.

# Jan 25th: Leek, thyme & butter bean gratin

Another from Georgie Mullen's "What to cook & when to cook it". I'm really liking this book, the Winter section has some hearty meals which are perfect for this time of year.

This one packs quite a mustardy punch as well, after I misread tsp as tbsp. Honestly it still works, I like a punchy flavour.
